TO DO LIST

- add bases
- add order generation
- add base detection

NOTE TO SELF:

i have no idea what i did but basically like my idea was to change the "new blue" for example as the top of the blue pile except techically i wouldn't need that anyway since the top of the blue pile must always be for example the suitcase so as long as it tracks the frist one it would be fine except that wouldn't work cause of the "ghost piles" or whatever the little spare ones so maybe the updated position tracker would be better but thats so complicated aagh

okay so each time a block lands on a pile, it adds to the pile count. it checks if its a pile bc it checks the position value of the box underneath it. and this position value should be stored under the name topBlue (example). and so it knows which pile it landed in and then checks what it is and if it should actually be in like topGreen. idk that works right? also the thing with the alerts is wrong bc it never returns true since you know something like that idek hope this helps lol.
