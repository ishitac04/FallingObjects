#What it is/does
My project is called Falling Objects, and it is a game where you can use the arrow keys to move objects around and stack them on top of each other to score points, but be careful not to stack two different objects or you lose the game!

#Why I made it
I made the project to try to experiment with a different type of game logic, where it registers the blocks underneath and falls constantly, and to try and build on my JavaScript knowledge. I also made it to be fun for other people to play it :)

#How I made it
I mostly used JavaScript for the moving parts and programming, along with some HTML and CSS to make the visual elements. I also used Sketch to create/edit all the artwork, adding the coloured borders to existing images and creating the home screen myself (even though hours don't track for that lol).

#What I struggled with and what I learned
I struggled with a lot of the stacking logic since the more functions I added, the more complex the code became, making it harder for me to remember my reasoning behind old parts of code and accidentally creating logic errors, which took a while for me to identify and fix. However, I learned how to do this in the end and built further on my JS knowledge by learning some new code constructs and commands :)
